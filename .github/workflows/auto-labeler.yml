# Automatically adds or removes labels from issues. Can be expanded to
# auto label cards and PRs as well. Issue templates are present
# however not always used. This will label issues that are missing them.

# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.
